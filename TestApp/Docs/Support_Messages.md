Hello, our app has ads and free books in free version. Our premium version gives user acces to locked books and removes ads.
New locked books will be added on an ongoing basis. So, every month there will be new books. So we decided to create 1 Lifetime purchase 
with acces to all books. And also we decided to create 2 auto-renewable subscriptions: monthly subscription and yearly subscription.
Both subscription will give user access to all existing content on monthly or yearly basis.
Thanks,
Pavel Vinnik
